# isaac-graph-checker

`isaac-graph-checker` is the library for marking graphs in the [Isaac Physics project](https://isaacphysics.org/about).

The basic idea behind the graph checker is that a graph can be recognised by it having certain features, for example:

- being an odd or even function
- passing through certain areas in a certain order
- have a particular slope in a particular area

The library can also be used in reverse to generate the features that would recognise a particular graph.
This is useful for setting questions.
